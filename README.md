# VidhiJain08-PM2.5-Sensor-Failure-Detection

There are 2 notebooks in the repo: 
1) Failure Detection: This notebook contains implemtation of several deep time series models like Wavenet, GRU and LSTM for predicting PM2.5 sensor failures upto 7 days in advance. Further this model classifies the sensor failure as temporary or permanent.
2) Sensor Forecasting: This notebook contains implemtation of LSTM and RNN in forecasting sesnor values in case of temporary failures.
